                        This country is over flowing with disgusting racism. Someone needs to do something about this injustice.

                    <li>
                        Action has to be taken to stop violence. It pains me to hear about horrible acts against another person. For those hurt, you are ALL in my prayers. #makeachange

                    <li>
                        This is the definition of a hate crime, and deniers are a massive part of the problem.
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Alyssa, 25</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It's disgusting that we have to be afraid in our places of worship. Where can we be safe? Where can we be free? Where can we be black?
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Patrick, 21</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It fills my heart with sorrow to hear that anyone could have enough hate toward one group of people to kill. My thoughts and prayers go out to those affected.

                    <li>
                        it's disgusting how these violent acts of hate feel like "just another sad breaking news alert" when it happens this often #endthehate

                    <li>
                        My heart aches for the families, the community, our country, and our world. May we one day learn to love one another and celebrate our differences.

                    <li>
                        Treat everyone as if they're your best friend no matter what. Love is a chain reaction. So love with everything you are. Charleston needs lots of love right now

                    <li>
                        My community and I are tired of being targeted. We need to feel safe and that seems impossible for us in this country or anywhere else. When will it end.

                    <li>
                        If you judge someone based on their race, religion, etc., you're going against the beliefs that founded this country we live in.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I am ashamed to share the same skin color as the shooter. I'm disgusted that those with love in their hearts can not live with out persecution.
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Angel, 18</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        History keeps repeating itself. Society is not learning from its mistakes. I am disgusted that it is 2015 and we still have not accepted each other.

                    <li>
                        For the opportunities to exist in this country where a man can walk in & kill innocent people is extremely disheartening. USA must fix this broken social system
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Valentina, 20</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Don't give up hope yet, or ever. The world is always a better place with people who aspire for the good of everyone. Love>hate

                    <li>
                        African Americans take one step forward and then get pushed back. Black communities are being destroyed because of an major issue that is ongoing, racism.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I don't understand the type of world we're living in. We're supposed to live in peace.

                    <li>
                        I am disgusted by how much hate is still in this world. I thought this stuff was eradicated 50 years ago? I guess not.
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Elliot, 18</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It is heartbreaking that we are still experiencing racism and hate in 2015. Praying for Charleston and the families and friends of those who were killed.

                    <li>
                        How do they want black people to not be defensive when they live in fear of being killed as soon as they step out the door
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Vanessa, 14</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Prayers going up for Charleston, SC. You can't even go to church and be safe anymore. What is this world really coming to?
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Bree, 20</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I am deeply saddened by the tragedy that happened in Charleston. Being black and knowing that in this day and age hate crimes are still happening is terrifying.
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Ayanna, 17</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Charleston, our nation stands behind you. You will be stronger than any force of evil.

                    <li>
                        I wish to see a world one day where there is no violence and hate such as this. I fear for the safety of many and my thoughts and best wishes go to Charleston
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Hannah, 16</cite>

                    <li>
                        I'm embarrassed of my race. The shooter is a domestic terrorist as far as I'm concerned.
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Abby, 21</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        This is inexcusable and heartbreaking. Black people are being massacred and Dylann Roof's words are echoed in the denial that this is anything but racism
                        <cite class="footnote">&mdash; Ryann, 19</cite>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        This is a racial hate crime and the suspect deserves no sympathy or justification for his actions.

                    <li>
                        Its really heartbreaking to see how low a person can be. We are all humans and none of us deserve to die because of our race. Every color is beautiful <3

                    <li>
                        This is an abomination against man kind. We are no different than you. We eat, work, live, and love like you. Why do you hate us so when nothing has been
