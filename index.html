                      This is a terrible tragedy! We must stand together as a nation more now than ever. Too many loved have been taken away.

                      I was excited to go to my first pride this summer. Now I'm afraid that going could be dangerous for me and my friends.

                      The definition of insanity is to repeat the same behavior and expect a different result. As long as our laws stay as is, this is our society. As long as we glorify hateful people, this is our society. STOP already.

                      my thoughts: prayers are incredible but praying is not the only thing we can do. We need to #ChangeForOrlando &amp; we need to now.
