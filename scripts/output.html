      It&apos;s important people recognize how much women contribute to society, and how important we are. People seem to forget that these days.

      International Women&apos;s Day is extremely important to me because people don&apos;t understand the importance of women in society. This is our chance to show the world just how valuable we are.

      Women have been cut out of history, treated like property, and kept out of power. International Women&apos;s Day celebrates women rising above the inequality that they have been handed. It also reminds us that we need to continue fighting. For black women, for Latina women, for native women, for Asian women, for Islamic women, for Jewish women, for LGBTQ+ women, for ALL women.

      This is important to me because women are still discriminated in today&apos;s world. Sure it&apos;s gotten a little bit better, but not by a lot. I feel that it is important to recognize women not just on March 8th but everyday.

      Women are so important to the community. From mothers to working women, they support the equal rights in the field that so many men are part of. I love being a woman in this day and age! Thank you to all those who were able to pave the way for modern day ladies today.

      International Woman&apos;s Day is important because it gives appreciation to the women who work hard for their families, communities, and society. Women are not given the praise we deserve; for what we have accomplished, and a women&apos;s day gives a little spot light on our achievements. This day is important because it raises awareness on women&apos;s rights and equality.

      International Woman&apos;s Day is important to me because it respectfully recognizes women. I, being a woman myself, believe that women deserve recognition due to the fact that they give life to the very people that populate the world and they have the same abilities and capacities as men. The thought that there are some who believe women are inferior to men proves why this day is necessary and significant. We are all human, with the same kind of emotions and genetic makeups. This day represents women not allowing men to make them feel inferior because no one can make them feel inferior without their consent.

      This day is a chance for women alike to gather around and celebrate each other. Women have been through a lot, my self included, and we need a day to acknowledge that. All the derogatory things that have been said or done to us needs to stop and we can use this day to say &quot;I am a strong individual person that does not need &apos;the man&apos; to do anything for me!&quot;

      As women, we are half of the population of this earth. Unfortunately, we are often treated as the lesser half. This is wrong and this needs to stop. Women deserve the respect and dignity given to every other man on the planet. We deserve the right to as great a life as any other human.
